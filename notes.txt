a RESTful Express app should provide for all the CRUD operations

            REST            |       non REST
                            |
GET        /api/users       |       /getUsers
                            |
POST       /api/users       |       /addUser
                            |
UPDATE     /api/users/:id   |       /updateUser
                            |
DELETE     /api/users/:id   |       /deleteUser

REST allows for more efficient Server Side Routing code
